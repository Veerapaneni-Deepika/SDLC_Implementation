# Requirements
## Introduction

* With the advancement of technology, library need to be ready for change and bring the technology to the library in order to retain their customer’s interest in visiting the library. Thus, in this situation, library’s system should be improved as well to facilitate staff or librarian in doing their work effectively.
* Library management system helps both students and library manager to keep a constant track of all the books available in the library. It allows both the admin and the student to search for the desired book. It becomes necessary for colleges to keep a continuous check on the books issued and returned. When we need to issue a book or collect a book we usually need to stand in long queue and wait for many hours, this system helps us to overcome the problem.
* This project helps me to extensively use file handling techniques and understand multiple C programming concepts.



## Research

* From ancient times the knowledge is spread by people
across the world in written form. First, the information is stored by carving words on copper using the sharp tool.
* The time the papers are invented and using the ink and feather of bird the information is started to store on paper.
which helped a lot for storing purpose.
* The methods are really difficult as compared to today’s digitized world, nowadays we can find anything on just one click. Digitization of library helps to keep all the records secured and retrievable which saves the paperwork and made library records easy to store.
